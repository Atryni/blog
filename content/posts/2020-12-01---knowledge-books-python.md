_**Knowledge books** is a mini series of constantly updated articles in which I share my more interesting discoveries_

Each language has its own nice extras. The same applies to the functions and usability of the basic functions of the programs. Of course, the important thing is that if some parts are not used on a daily basis, they may be forgotten. Therefore, here are some brief notes on this language functions and methods of implantation. Written knowledge cannot be forgotten.
